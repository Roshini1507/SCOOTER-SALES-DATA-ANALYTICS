# SCOOTER-SALES-DATA-ANALYTICS

This repository is all about performing Data Analytics and Visualization using Excel.
The raw sales data has been checked to remove duplicates, identify nulls, and standardize number formats. Then the data is transformed into a table for manipulation.

# BUSINESS QUESTIONS:

# Sales by Salesperson :
I want the sales information for each salesperson in a pivot table for easy filtering. They should be grouped by state as well. The columns should include Total Clients, the Average Sales Per Client, and Total Sales Per Salesperson. I have included a slicer to easily filter by salesperson.

# Sales by State:
While we are able to consolidate the last pivot table to view sales data by state, I want to clean up the table and include different columns. I created a new pivot table and slicer, organized by state. The new columns include Total Sales, Average Sales Per Client, and Total Commission earned.

# Excel Dashboard
The sales data is then visualized into a dashboard to display our findings. It includes our Pivot Tables, Pivot Bar Charts with Slicers, and a Pie Chart to display Sales Revenue by State.
